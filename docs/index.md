# Welcome to the Geometric Fitting Problems Documentation

This project aims to present algorithms in Geometric Algebra (GA) implemented in the Julia programming language. It includes an algorithm for fitting spheres using tangential distance, planes using orthogonal distance, and an algorithm capable of fitting and classifying objects. Additionally, we introduce a LOVO-CGA algorithm for solving detection problems.
