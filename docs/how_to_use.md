# How to use

This section introduces three fitting algorithms: `AGCGA`, proposed in ..., `AACGA`, proposed in ..., and the algorithm we propose in this work, `ICGA`. Additionally, we present a combined fitting and classification algorithm, `fittingclass`, and a detection algorithm, `LOVO-CGA`.

## Fitting

To use any of the fitting algorithms, you need a matrix containing a set of points, where each row represents a point in Euclidean space, and the target object to fit specified as a string. Supported objects include: `sphere`, `plane`, `circle`, `line`.

### Syntax

```julia
ICGA(data::Matrix, object::String)
```

### Example

Consider a matrix `D` representing a set of points from a sphere. You can fit the object as follows:

```julia
julia> ICGA(D, "sphere")
```

## Fitting and Classification

To use the `fittingclass` algorithm, provide a matrix containing a set of points corresponding to the object set `Q = {hyperspheres, hyperplanes, hypercircles, lines}` and two threshold values, `ε₁` and `ε₂`. For noise generated by a normal distribution, tests conducted with `ε₁ = 1.0` and `ε₂ = 10e-3` showed good results.

### Syntax

```julia
fittingclass(data::Matrix, ε₁::Float64, ε₂::Float64)
```

### Example

Consider a matrix `D` representing a set of points. You can apply the algorithm as follows:

```julia
julia> fittingclass(D, 1.0, 10e-3)
```

## Detection

To detect objects in the set `Q = {hyperspheres, hyperplanes, hypercircles, lines}`, use the function `LOVOCGA`. The input parameters are: a matrix of points, the number of outliers, an initial guess, the method to be used, the object to be detected, and an optional threshold `ε` (default: `1.0e-4`).

### Syntax

```julia
LOVOCGA(data::Matrix, nout::Int, θ::Vector, method::String, object::String, ε=1.0e-4)
```

### Example

Consider a matrix `D` representing a set of 20 points from a circle, where 4 of them are outliers. You can proceed as follows:

```julia
julia> LOVOCGA(D, 4, [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], "AGCGA", "circle", ε=1.0e-4)
```
