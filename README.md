# GeometricFittingProblems
This project is focused in Geometric Fitting considering the following directions: generate problems, geometric algebra approach and solvers.

This project aims to present algorithms in Geometric Algebra (GA) implemented in the Julia programming language. It includes an algorithm for fitting spheres using tangential distance, planes using orthogonal distance, and an algorithm capable of fitting and classifying objects. Additionally, we introduce a LOVO-CGA algorithm for solving detection problems.
